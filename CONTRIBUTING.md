Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Libraries that are PHP 5.3+, Composer-installable, PSR compliant, tested and documented are preferred.
* Please make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Prefix duplicate library names with their vendor or namespace followed by a space: Orno\DI would be Orno DI.
